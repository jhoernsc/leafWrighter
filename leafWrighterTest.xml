<p><q who="#alice">"How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!"</q> thought <persName tbe:ontStatus="realistic">Alice</persName>, <q who="#alice">"I might just as well be at school at once."</q> However, she got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the <title type="song"><tbe:animalName tbe:ontStatus="realistic">Lobster</tbe:animalName>-Quadrille</title>, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came very queer indeed:—</p>

<q who="#lobster">'You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.'</q>

<l>As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose</l>
<l>Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes."</l>
